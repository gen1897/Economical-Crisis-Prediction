# Description
Notebooks to analyze data to make a ML model that can predict Economic Crisis using macroeconomic data.  

Used this paper [https://editorialexpress.com/cgi-bin/conference/download.cgi?db_name=EEAESEM2019&paper_id=1163] as reference. Changed features and reduced number of countries trying to improve model.

# Objective
Do a simplified model that works fine in a reduced group of countries.

# Dataset
JST-Macrohistory DataBase. Find it in the next document:

# Files
## Model.ipynb
Jupyter Notebook that contains model obtaining.

## JSTdatasetR4.xlsx
Excel file that contains data.

## EDA.ipynb
Jupyter Notebook used as dump to analyze data and features.
